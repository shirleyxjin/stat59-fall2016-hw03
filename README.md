## STAT 159 - Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science
### Homework 3

**Author**: Shirley Jin

**Objective**: The objective of this homework assignment is to recreate the the regression results on sales and advertising effectiveness displayed in section 3.2 Mutliple Linear Regression (Chapter 3) of the book [**An Introduction to Statistical Learning**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) authored by Gareth James.

**Structure**: The project file structure is that of the following:

**Details**: Code folder contains 3 folders, scripts folder contains R script codes used to analyze the data, functions folder contains functions used to compute regression statistics and tests folder contains the tests to verify the accuracy of functions. Data folder contains the main data set `Advertising.csv` and other data stored using R. The project report is in the report folder. `make` can be called to recreate the analysis.
